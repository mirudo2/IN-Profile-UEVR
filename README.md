UEVR profile that fixes most of the crashes in this game.

**Installing the plugin is very simple.**
- Just download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/mirudo2/IN-Profile-UEVR/releases).
- Extract the downloaded file to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\UnrealVRMod`, after that the profile was successfully installed.
> Tip: if you are not seeing the **AppData** folder, it means that it is hidden. Just enable/show hidden files and folders in the `Explorer` settings.

### Gamepad commands and features
You will need [UEVR Nightly](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases) and the *Fix Native* function will take care of everything. This profile already configures everything for you, in addition to fixing some crashes.

- Adjust the `ScreenPercentage` in the cvars tab, according to your preference, the profile default is `80.000000`.
- Use `L3 + A` or `Q` to re-center whenever you want.
- Take pictures as much as you want with `L3 + R3` (no crashes now, thanks to the native method).

- Attach/detach the character's camera with `L3 + RB` (Adjust with `L3 + LT, L3 + RT, L3 + X, L3 + Y`).
- Hold `L3 + R3` for a while to open the UEVR GUI.

- Double-clicking with `R3` will toggle freecam mode on/off.
- Double-clicking with `L3` will take a quick screenshot. (This image will be saved in your Windows Pictures folder).

- Don't touch the UEVR `main` tab or the game will crash moments later. I'm not sure about the other functions, but in the cvars tab you can mess around as you like.
